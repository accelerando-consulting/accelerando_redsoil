# Accelerando Redsoil Breakout

The [Accelerando Redsoil](https://accelerando.com.au/) is a minimal
breakout board for eByte's ebyte_e73_2g4m08s1, which contains
an nrf52840, either with a chip antenna or IPX.   It breaks out all of
the outer castellated holes on the eByte module, and uses the under-board lands for
on-board parts (eg the LED on P0.04).

## CircuitPython Pin Defs

CircuitPython pin definitions hove to the NRF pin numbers, because
doing otherwise (like Sparkfun chose to do) breaks my brain.
